#ngMadLibs

See the working application [on github pages](http://danielrob.github.io/ngMadLibs).

An exercise in Thinkful.com's Angular Js course.  

As an additional challenge I took the instructions 100% literally and added some constraints. All in all I required:  

* using ngRepeat instead of specifying 9 input boxes
* having each input box a different size
* keeping semantic accessors for the ng-models
* displaying {{ and }} when the models were empty.
